# Employee Salary Progression project
Welcome to the **Employee Salary Progression Analysis** project repository. As a data analyst, I conducted an **end-to-end SQL analysis** to evaluate how employee salaries evolve, focusing on promotions, salary hikes, and growth rate ranking.
This project demonstrates SQL problem-solving using two approaches:

1. A **step-by-step method** (with multiple CTEs for clarity).

2. **An optimized version** (with fewer CTEs for efficiency).

Both approaches lead to the same **final consolidated report table** that answers key business questions.
## ðŸ“ŠProject Overview
In this project, I assumed the role of an **HR/Compensation analyst** for a company, aiming to better understand employee salary progression. The business requirements guided the SQL queries, which analyze compensation data to highlight promotions, salary hikes, and career growth patterns.

## ðŸ“‹SQL Analysis Tasks
### 1. Find Latest Salary
Retrieve the most recent salary for each employee.

### 2. Total Number of Promotions
Count how many promotions each employee has received.

### 3. Maximum Salary Hike %
Identify the highest percentage salary increase between any two consecutive salary changes.

### 4. Salary Never Decreased
Determine which employees have never experienced a salary drop over time.

### 5. Average Time Between Salary Changes
Calculate the average gap (in months) between salary changes for each employee.

### 6. Salary Growth Ranking
Rank employees by their salary growth rate (from first salary to latest), breaking ties by earliest join date.

## ðŸŽ¯Final Deliverable
All the above metrics are combined into one consolidated table.

## ðŸ“ŒRecommendations
Based on this analysis, hereâ€™s how HR or management can use the insights:

- **Identify top performers**: High growth rate + frequent promotions.

- **Spot pay consistency issues**: Employees with salary decreases can be flagged for review.

- **Optimize promotion cycles**: Long gaps between raises may suggest morale or retention risks.

- **Benchmark salary hikes**: Maximum hike % helps in evaluating fairness across teams
